FAQ

* I get an error on startup: "Cannot start RDVR: id3tool does not appear to be installed." or "Cannot start RDVR: fIcy does not appear to be installed." What's going on?

RDVR requires two external command-line tools to record shows (fIcy) and modify MP3 metadata (id3tool). These must be installed prior to running RDVR. They should be available on your PATH.

* You do realize "DVR" stands for "Digital Video Recorder", so "RDVR" stands for "Radio Digital Video Recorder" which makes no sense. You do realize that, right?

You're damn pedantic, aren't you?
